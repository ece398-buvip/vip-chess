abstracts the stepper hardware to a function to set the magnet to a specific position in real world units.  Need to know width and length of movable area and the equivalent number of steps required.  keeps track of current magnet position and allows for zeroing of that position by running into limit switches.  Also define a tolerance for how accurate it can be, especially considering the play in where the limit switches are clicked.
