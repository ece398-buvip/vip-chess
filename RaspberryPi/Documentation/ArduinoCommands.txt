This module is responsible for communicating to the arduino.  We will have a list of commands that we can send to the arduino.  We will probably want two files for this module, Serial.py and ArduinoCommands.py.  The serial file just provides some simple functions for sending commands to the arduino over serial.  The ArduinoCommands file will have a list of functions that send a command to the arduino using Serial.py and wait for a response before returning
